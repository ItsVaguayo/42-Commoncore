I am a student at **42 Barcelona** since September 2025.  
This repository is a technical logbook for my journey through the Common Core curriculum.  
Here you’ll find a clear overview of my progress, methodology, and technical growth, aligned with the updated structure and requirements of 42.

## 💡 About 42 Barcelona

[42 Network](https://www.42network.org) is a global coding school based on peer-to-peer, project-driven learning.  
At 42 Barcelona, students tackle real computing problems in C, Python, networking, systems, AI and team projects—gaining not only technical skills, but autonomy and collaboration.

## 🛠️ Common Core: Technical Highlights

- **Language mastery:** Intensive use of C in early circles, moving to Python and cross-language applications.
- **Algorithmic thinking:** Implementation and benchmarking of efficient data structures and algorithms.
- **Networking & system tools:** Gradual introduction to systems, network concepts, virtualization and large group workflows.
- **AI integration:** New staged approach introducing LLMs, RAG, agentic design and practical AI with each circle.
- **Documentation:** All projects must include a technical `README.md`, tests, architecture notes, and can be subject to recoding during evaluations.

## 🚀 How the Common Core Works

- **Technical escalation:** Each circle introduces higher complexity and expands language/tool use.
- **AI adoption:** AI steps up gradually via specific projects (LLMs, RAG, agentic methods).
- **Documentation & evaluation:** Every project requires a structured technical README and is subject to peer-evaluation. Recode sessions may be required.
- **No deep project explanations here:** See each project’s folder for technical details, structure, and documentation.

---

## 📂 Repo Organization

- Root-level folders for each circle/project  
- Each project: Source code, README, test scripts, architecture diagrams or benchmarks (if applicable)

---

## 🎯 Goal

Grow as a systems, algorithmic, and AI-ready developer.  
Master collaborative and technical skills, adapt to new tech, and solve real-world problems from day one.
