## 🔹 About 42 School

[42](https://www.42.fr/) is a **project-based programming school** with no traditional classes, teachers, or grades. Learning is entirely **peer-to-peer**, and students advance by completing projects that gradually increase in complexity.  

At 42, students develop not only technical skills but also **soft skills** such as:  

- **Problem-solving:** tackling challenges independently and efficiently  
- **Collaboration:** working with peers in group projects  
- **Creativity:** designing solutions and optimizing code  
- **Adaptability:** learning new technologies and approaches quickly  
- **Self-learning:** researching, experimenting, and debugging autonomously  

This approach allows students to become highly **self-sufficient developers**, prepared for real-world programming tasks and team-based projects.
